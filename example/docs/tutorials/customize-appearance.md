# Customize appearance

## Cropper

There are plenty of ways to customize cropper, and there will be described the most important ones.

Below schematically represented the internal structure of cropper and its main components.

![Internal structure](../.vuepress/assets/tutorials/cropper-structure.svg)

### Cropper

To customize `cropper` itself, that can be imagined as wrapper for the `area`, `background` and `image`, you can pass class name to `classname` prop.

It can be useful if you want to set background of filled area at the scheme above or don't want to create and style cropper wrapper.

### Image

You can apply different effects (for example blurring) to image by passing custom class name to `imageClassname` prop. By default it has `0.5` only opacity.

### Background

Background is literally background directly under image. By default it's black rectangle, but you are able to change, let's say, its color by passing class name to `backgroundClassname` prop.

## Stencil

There may be numerous different stencils with different ways to customize them. But there will be described customizing of default stencils like ([RectangleStencil](/components/rectangle-stencil.html) and [CircleStencil](/components/circle-stencil.html))

![Internal structure](../.vuepress/assets/tutorials/stencil-structure.svg)

To customize stencil you should pass props to `stencilProps` props as object (read [here](/tutorials/recipes.html#passing-props-to-a-stencil) in detail)

### Handler

You are able to customize handle by the following ways:
- change handler component
- add custom handler classnames
- remove or add handlers at one of six positions

#### Change handler component

To change handler component just pass the name of globally registered handler component or handler component options object to `handlerComponent` prop.

```html
<cropper
	:src="img"
	:stencil-props="{
		handlerComponent: 'myHandler'
	}"
/>
```

#### Customize the classnames

To add handler classnames you should pass an object to `handlersClassnames` prop. All available classnames are represented at the example below

```html
<cropper
	:src="img"
	:stencil-props="{
		handlersClassnames: {
			default: 'handler',
			hover: 'handler--hover',
			eastNorth: 'handler--east-north',
			north: 'handler--north',
			westNorth: 'handler--west-north',
			west: 'handler--west',
			westSouth: 'handler--west-south',
			south: 'handler--south',
			eastSouth: 'handler--east-south',
			east: 'handler--ease',
		}
	}"
/>
```

Pay attention to `default` classname. If you want just change classname of a handler you should anyway pass an object:
```html
<Cropper
	:src="img"
	:stencil-props="{
		handlerClassnames: {
			default: 'handler',
		}
	}"
/>
```

#### Customize the list of handlers

To change the list of handlers you should pass an object `handlers` to stencil props.

```html
<cropper
	:src="img"
	:stencil-props="{
		handlers: {
			eastNorth: true,
			north: false,
			westNorth: true,
			west: false,
			westSouth: true,
			south: false,
			eastSouth: true,
			east: false,
		}
	}"
/>
```

::: warning Remember!
If you don't set `[direction]: true` the correspondenting handler will be hidden, so if you pass an empty object all handlers will be hidden
:::

### Lines

You are able to customize lines by the same three ways:
- change line component (`lineComponent`)
- add custom line classnames (`linesClassnames`)
- remove or add lines at one of four positions (`lines`)

Line component by default is [SimpleLine](/components/simple-line.html). Each line is a narrow block with applied border style. So to change the apperance of line you should change the border style.

The example is given below
```css
.line {
	border-style: dashed;
	border-color: red;
}
```

::: warning Know issue
Currently there are problems with changing the line width.

### Preview

The necessity to change preview appearance is pretty rare. But if you want to change it you may pass custom classname to `previewClassname` prop.

```html
<cropper
	:src="img"
	:stencil-props="{
		previewClassname: 'preview'
	}"
	stencil-component="circle-stencil"
/>
```
```css
.preview {
	border: dashed 1px rgba(255,255,255, 0.25);
}
```
